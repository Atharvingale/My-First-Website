Welcome to My First Website, created as part of an assignment by Atharva G Ingale. This static website is designed using Bootstrap, focusing on responsive design, layout structure, and basic styling principles. It serves as an introductory project to web development and is a demonstration of my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Key Features:

1. Responsive Design: The website automatically adjusts its layout for various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. Structured Layout: Clear and organized sections, making the website easy to navigate and visually appealing.

3. Bootstrap Framework: Utilizes Bootstrap components like navigation bars, buttons, and cards to create a modern and professional look.
